This is a TLI site for sharing my learning related notes. 

I am passionate about being an well-rounded software engineer because it is a field that is constantly evolving and offers a lot of opportunities for creativity and innovation. I enjoy working with code and solving complex problems, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I am passionate about helping others learn and grow in their careers.


###  My interests include
* Arial, drone, and landscape photography
* Reducing cognative load by improving user interface
* Use of computer vision tools to extract data form media
* Designing automation though software and hardware
* Reducing complexity of this complex world though software and automation. .  
* Volleyball and staying active
* Mentoring... and learning from others. 
* I care very much about climate change, it's very real!   


... and I like being funny, often it works, sometimes it fails to amuse everyone.

As I grew and developed in my career field, I am greatful to everyone who guided me though the development journy. Hopefully these notes will inform a few people about the tools, the technologies and the practices out there. When we share knowledge, we empower others to make better decisions, to be more informed, and to lead more fulfilling lives. Knowledge is a gift that we can give to others, and I am committed to learning and sharing what I gathered through this TLI (Today I learned site).
