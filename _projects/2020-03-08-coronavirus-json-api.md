## Purpose:

The project was used to serve ase API backend for https://zmsp.github.io/coronavirus
During the start of COVID-19 pandemic, I wanted to create a site that services as a window to covid statistics.

## Data sources

The data is updated from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and
Engineering [JHU CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) repository and hosted on
https://github.com/zmsp/coronavirus-json-api/ JHU CSSE updates the data about twice daily.

Additionally, the total counts are updated every hour from https://www.worldometers.info/

The project is now dormant a there are many alternative APIs avaiable.
