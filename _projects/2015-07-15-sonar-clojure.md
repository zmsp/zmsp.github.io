# The story: 


The sonar-security plugin was created to help secure clojure code. It does this by scanning code and identifying potential security threats. If a threat is identified, the plugin would detect the error and hilight the code where the error occured. It used some 3rd party modules wrapped around sonar API to push errors back to a sonar instance. 

Code was written by me and another intern who helped out with testing. 


# Documentation

# Install

You can install latest stable version from PyPI:

```pip3 install myTesla```

# Usage:

```python
import myTesla

my_model_s = myTesla.connect('test@example.com', 'MySecurePassword')
charge_state = my_model_s.charge_state()
door_lock = my_model_s.door_lock()
my_model_s.honk_horn()
print(charge_state)
print(door_lock)
```

# Documentation:

This program was build using API documentation listed
on  [https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/.). The functions closely follow the API
documentation. Please see this page for detailed information of the function parameters.

## Initiating connection

In order to initiate connection, the following information is needed.

The arguements for initiating the connection is the following:

```python
def __init__(self, email='', password='',
            vehicle_index=0,
            base_url="https://owner-api.teslamotors.com",
            access_token=None,
            tesla_backend_token_response=None,
            ownerapi_client_id="81527cff06843c8634fdc09e8ac0abefb46ac849f38fe1e431c2ef2106796384",
            ownerapi_client_secret="c7257eb71a564034f9419ee651c7d0e5f7aa6bfbd18bafb5c5c033b093bb2fa3",
            )
```

### Connection argument description descriptioons:

The details of these parameters can be found on this page See https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/api-basics/authentication
