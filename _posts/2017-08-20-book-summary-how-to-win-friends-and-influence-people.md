Tl;dr: Read the book and don't be the annoying guy.

“Any fool can criticize, complain, and condemn—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.”

### Overview

"How to Win Friends and Influence People," penned in 1936, remains a bestseller in its category. It's a timeless self-help guide, with principles that stand the test of time. Many modern self-help and communication books draw from its teachings. The book underscores the importance of valuing people and making them feel appreciated. Split into four major parts, each chapter concludes with a summary of the main ideas.

##### Disclaimer: Dale Carnegie advises careful note-taking, reflection, and cautious application of his teachings to one's life. He suggests periodically rereading the book. These words complement rather than substitute for reading the book.

### Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

1. *Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain.*  
(Human nature recoils from negativity.)
   - Example: Rather than saying, "You did a terrible job with this report," try, "I appreciate your effort on this report. However, there are areas we could improve together."
2. *Give honest, sincere appreciation.*  
(Appreciation brings out the best in people; everyone desires to feel important.)
   - Example: Thanking a colleague for their hard work on a project, acknowledging their contributions.
3. *Arouse in the other person an eager want.*  
(To catch a fish, use bait it likes, not chocolate.)
   - Example: When selling a product, focus on how it fulfills the customer's needs and desires.

### Six Ways To Make People Like You

1. *Become genuinely interested in other people.*  
(You can make more friends in two months by being interested in them than in two years by making them interested in you.)
   - Example: Asking someone about their hobbies or interests and actively listening to their response.
2. *Smile.*  
(A smile can go a long way.)
   - Example: Greeting colleagues with a warm smile each morning.
3. *Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.*  
(Remember and use a person's name during interaction.)
   - Example: Addressing a client by their name during a meeting or conversation.
4. *Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.*  
(Listen actively; maintain a talk-to-listen ratio of 1:3.)
   - Example: Engaging in active listening during a conversation by nodding and asking follow-up questions.
5. *Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.*
   - Example: Discussing topics that the other person finds engaging and relevant.
6. *Make the other person feel important—and do it sincerely.*  
(Use kind words and avoid arrogance.)
   - Example: Expressing gratitude and admiration for a friend's talents or accomplishments.

### Win People To Your Way Of Thinking

1. *The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.*  
(Welcome disagreement, control temper, listen first, and be honest.)
   - Example: Instead of arguing, seek common ground and understanding in a discussion.
2. *Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “You’re wrong.”*  
(The phrase “You’re wrong” makes enemies.)
   - Example: Acknowledging differing opinions in a conversation and seeking to understand them.
3. *If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.*  
(Do not try to defend when you are wrong.)
   - Example: Acknowledging and apologizing for a mistake in a professional setting.
4. *Begin in a friendly way.*  
(Start conversations in a friendly manner.)
   - Example: Initiating a difficult conversation with a positive and approachable tone.
5. *Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately.*  
(Shift mentality to a positive state.)
   - Example: Presenting ideas or suggestions in a way that elicits agreement and enthusiasm.
6. *Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.*  
(Linked with the fourth point of "Six Ways To Make People Like You.")
   - Example: Encouraging a colleague to share their thoughts and ideas during a meeting.
7. *Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.*
   - Example: Presenting a suggestion as though it originated from the other person, fostering ownership and commitment.
8. *Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.*
   - Example: Putting oneself in another's shoes to better understand their perspective and motivations.
9. *Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires.*
   - Example: Showing understanding and empathy towards a friend's goals and aspirations.
10. *Appeal to nobler motives.*
   - Example: Encouraging someone to take action based on their desire to make a positive impact on others.
11. *Dramatize your ideas.*
   - Example: Using vivid imagery or storytelling to convey the significance of a concept or proposal.
12. *Throw down a challenge.*
   - Example: Motivating a team by setting ambitious goals and encouraging them to surpass expectations.

### Be A Leader: How To Change People Without Giving Offense Or Arousing Resentment

1. *Begin with praise and honest appreciation.*
   - Example: Commending an employee for their dedication before addressing areas for improvement.
2. *Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.*
   - Example: Providing constructive feedback in a way that focuses on solutions rather than faults.
3. *Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing others.*
