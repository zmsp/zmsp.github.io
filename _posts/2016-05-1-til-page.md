**Why I Made a "Today I Learned" Page**

Ever since 2014 when Github introduced github pages, I wanted to make my own page there. I played around with it a bit, but I never really felt the push to set it up. Then, a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon [Thoughtbotâ€™s "Today I Learned" (TIL)](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) page. TIL is like an online diary where you jot down things you've learned. These TIL pages seem to offer a bunch of benefits:

- Helps you remember what you've learned.
- Acts as a record of your learning journey.
- Allows you to give back to the community by sharing what you've learned.

I encourage everyone to create their own TIL page. There are lots of reasons to do it. Maybe you want to share your knowledge and experiences with others in your field, or perhaps you want to establish your credibility and expertise. Or maybe you just like writing and sharing your thoughts. Whatever your reasons, give it a try!
