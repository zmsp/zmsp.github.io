Why I created Today I learned (TIL) page

Ever since Github introduced github pages back in 2014, I wanted to create my own github page. I fiddled with the page a little bit but never had the motivation or the need to setup a page. Few weeks ago I came by [Thoughtbotâ€™s TIL (Today I Learned)](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) page. TIL is basically your online diary of things you have learned. TIL pages seem to have three fold benefits-

-   Improve your recalling ability,

-   Keep a documentation of what you have learned

-   Most of all contribute and give back to the community
